"The Dragon Lies Bleeding"

Ride through the valley in thunder and rain
The battle is raging, redeem this domain
The castle of Eden lies silent above
Darkness surrounds us, away we must go

I look through the eyes of the world
I see there's a stranger among us
Awaiting a sign from above
To conquer the power and the glory

Enter the battle, our will to enchain
bringing us forward, defeating the pain
Into the meeting with swords made of steel
We're standing together, the secret reveals

I look through the eyes of the world
I know who's the stranger among us
Awaiting a sign from above to conquer
The power and the glory

Come across to the promised land
Close your eyes I will take your hand
Through the river of steel we'll go
When the dragon lies bleeding

Above the glory we'll carry on
Now the time has come to return back home
The setting sun illuminates the dead
On the battlefield it's shining red

Silent lies Eden on top of the moor
We're fighting with honor protecting our Lord
The last one survivor lies bleeding, I kneel
Into his heart I settle the steel

I look through the eyes of the world
There is no stranger among us
we march through the end of the world
in search of the power and the glory

Come across to the promise land...

"The Metal Age"

Icy water on my hands
The roar of thunder everywhere
I close my eyes, I realize I'm far away from home
In the twilight zone, the shadows mourn

Out of the night came the shining...(from)
The metal age

Ivory towers conceal my eyes
Caught up in a long lost time
Where no one speaks, at liberty, they guard their destiny
To forge the steel, they will reveal

Out of the night came the shining...

I'm falling into the breach
I'm a stranger in this land, I'm falling

Standing strong , the brave and the elder
With scars seldom forgotten, above it all
Come with us, offering shelter from the icy wind that shiver
Come with us to the twilight zone

You're welcome to The metal age

Hear the bell begins to chime
The moonlit skies burst out in flames
The time has come, it must be done, let the power be unchained
By the force within, let the war begin

Out of the night came the shining...

"Hammerfall"

Silent screaming, you're on your own
Balancing on a blade
Between what's right and what is wrong
Don't loose your faith, don't sit there in silence
Show your strength, let's hail the metal Gods,
Bare your heart

All for one, our burning hearts will live forever
One for all, together standing strong

Hammerfall - we will prevail
Hammerfall - let us hail

Hammerfall - we will prevail
Hammerfall - let us hail

We share a dream, the future is ours
A Metal Heart is hard to tear apart, heed the call
A flash of light calls out the providers
We run this race, but we will never crawl, all hail
Hammerfall

All for one, our burning hearts will live forever
One for all, together standing strong

Hammerfall - we will prevail
Hammerfall - let us hail
Hammerfall - we will prevail
Hammerfall - let us hail

Just follow your heart, don't listen to the crowd
The wisdom, the voice is calling from inside
The time long forgotten will soon come again
Prepare for the meeting, the Gods of Metal reign

"I Believe"

Is is too late to go in peace, I wonder how
how these things did start anyway
Maybe too late to find a way, when the
trail of grief is marked with memories

Now when you're gone, the warmth
of the sun seems so faraway

I believe - in everything I see, every
second is a miracle for me
I believe - after sunshine comes the
rain, and when it's pouring down
the only thing I feel is pain

I walk alone through shapeless dreams
my only home is the wasteland that I cross
I close the door and turn the key
those days of joy are barely memories
Now when you're gone, your star will
shine on, wont you shine for me

I believe- in everything I see, every
second is a miracle for me
I believe- after sunshine comes the
rain, and when it's pouring down
the only thing I feel is pain

"Child Of The Damned"

You made me see right past myself, well beyond
my fears, realized I'm synchronized, far beyond my years
I'm so guard unto them, I serve unto their souls
now that I'm addicted, my hunger only grows

I'm a child of the damned, I follow where I go
rigging to the cross, as holy as a whore
I'm just a child of the damned

Witches coven, the time has come for those sabbatical
years, revelation is the message, for all in all to hear
Prophets slayed, mankind arrayed into mass submission
evil's here, the lord of hell gives you the proposition

I'm a child of the damned, I follow where I go
rigging to the cross, as holy as a whore
I'm just a child of the damned

Give away your life goals, your meaning and ambition
it means nothing to you, after all it's superstition
Do not be afraid, the world is near the end
is it better to rule in hell, than it is to serve in heaven?

I'm a child of the damned, I follow where I go
rigging to the cross, as holy as a whore
I'm just a child of the damned

"Steel Meets Steel"

Back in 1095, when the call to arms came
we had the red cross sown on
Sent to save the holy land and crush the infidels
with strength from above

STEEL MEETS STEEL

On towards victory we march, the guiding star
lead us to the battle field
There, the heathens were subdued, and in the end
we forced them all to yield or die

STEEL MEETS STEEL

In July in '99, the Holy City was stormed and won
Jerusalem was freed, we thanked the lord for our glory

We, the Templars, have survived by honor and pride
and the blessing of the sword
The quest of the war, forever sung
to the sound of steel meets steel

STEEL MEETS STEEL

"Stone Cold"

Outcast a time of war, when mankind lost control
of life and death, under surveillance

I watch the children pray, while god just turns away
out in the ruins they seek shelter
These streets were once my home, but those
golden days are gone, now I'm fighting to survive

Stone cold, man or machine
Stone cold, the end of our dream

The word is on the street, it's kill or to be killed
with no exception you are on your own

We should have seen it all along, the writings
on the wall, tell me what have we become

Stone cold ...

Who do you believe in now, when the prophecy
came true, the final deja vu

These streets were once my home ...

Stone cold ...

"Unchained"

Undying nightfall, a king with no crown
dethroned, imprisoned in chains
Duel the black horse, the Swordsmen must kneel
condemned to serve within the shadows
Put 'em next to their King

Out of the fire and into the night
a handful of brave men appeared
Crimson thunder running through their veins
a bond that will last forever
Nothing's stronger than ...

Brothers in arms are fighting tonight
the Forces of steel meet again
born in the fire, they look to the sky
power of metal unchained

Time has come, break out of these chains
FIGHT! proud for your kingdom
Behind the defenders the king marches on
by divine intervention
They are fighting with ...

Brothers in arms are fighting tonight
the Forces of Steel live again
born in the fire, they look to the sky
the power of metal unchained

Past many nights they fought on
and by the moonlight the battle was won
but still the black horse is running
knowing were the power will lead

Brothers in arms are fighting tonight
the Forces of Steel live again
born in the fire, they look to the sky
the power of metal unchained

"Glory To The Brave"

Snow is falling down on this glorious land
colors fading, turning into white again
To fallen heroes angels sting, they cry their winter tears
endless mourning days will turn to years

So this is goodbye, I take leave of you and
spread your wings and you will fly away now, fly away now

Nothing on earth stays forever
but none of your deeds were in vain
Deep in our hearts you will live again
you're gone to the home of the brave

Every solemn moment I will treasure inside
even though it's hard to understand
that a silent wind can blow that candle out
taking everything leaving the pain far behind

You call out my name, but your voice is fading
into the wind, embraced, you'll fly away now, fly away now

Nothing on earth stays forever
but none of your deeds were in vain
Deep in our hearts you will live again
you're gone to the home of the brave

My eyes are closed I feel you're faraway (so close)
far beyond that shining star
I know you'll find what you've been fighting for
far beyond that shining star

Down on bended knee I pray, bring courage to these souls
make 'em live forever in the heart of the bold
So I say farewell my friends, I hope we'll meet again
when my time has come to fall from the grace

So this is goodbye, I take leave of you and
spread your wings and you will fly away now, fly away now

Nothing on earth stays forever
but none of your deeds were in vain
Deep in our hearts you will live again
you're gone to the home of the brave
