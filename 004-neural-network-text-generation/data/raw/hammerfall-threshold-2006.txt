"Threshold"

There are clouds on the horizon
Shifting colors, heavy rain
High above the roaring thunder
Shooting bullets through your brain
There's something wicked left behind
A befell sight, a calming, sinister state of your mind

Behold the skies; the port of heaven takes the stairway down to hell
The gate is open lift the curse
We set aside our dreams, ambitions; we are one we will unite
At the Threshold of the universe
We will rise!

Late at night they heard the sirens
From a place so far away
A light forces mighty brethren in a vesture of decay
They are the legions of the night
Turning darkness into... turning the dark into light

Behold the skies; the port of heaven takes the stairway down to hell
The gate is open lift the curse
We set aside our dreams, ambitions; we are one we will unite
At the Threshold of the universe, universe
We will rise!

Behold the skies; the port of heaven takes the stairway down to hell
The gate is open lift the curse
We set aside our dreams, ambitions; we are one we will unite
At the Threshold of the universe

Behold the skies; the port of heaven takes the stairway down to hell
The gate is open lift the curse
We set aside our dreams, ambitions; we are one we will unite
At the Threshold of the universe, universe, universe, universe

"The Fire Burns Forever"

Fire, burns. Fire, burns. Fire, Burns.

You danced with the devil.
Now your soul is bruised and scarred.
There ain't no pride and dignity.
We've been down the rusty boulevard.
You lived your life, thought you'd be immortalized.
The moral of your story, what goes up must come back down.

Fire, burns.
The Fire Burns Forever.
Fire, burns.
The Fire Burns Forever More.

A moment of silence.
Just before you hit the stage.
This is your day of reckoning.
To pay back all the dues and turn the page.
You hit rock bottom and you stood the count to ten.
Came back to harvest glory, now your star will shine forever.

Fire, burns.
The Fire Burns Forever.
Fire, burns.
The Fire Burns Forever More.

Fire, burns.
The Fire Burns Forever.
Fire, burns.
The Fire Burns Forever More.

'Cause every step, the light races follow.
'Cause every move we make, might be our last mistake.

Fire, burns.
The Fire Burns Forever.
Fire, burns.
The Fire Burns Forever More.

Fire, burns.
The Fire Burns Forever.
Fire, burns.
The Fire Burns Forever More.

Fire, fire, burn.

"Rebel Inside"

A battle with pride and ego.
A journey that started long ago.
Life time of passion and war.
Rebel Inside.

Legends in our lifetime.
We have our hearts set in the past.
And eyes towards the future.
Rebel Inside.

The thunder 5 are riding once again.
Hell bent on blazing our own trail.
To seek out fortune and the fame.
We're warriors, warriors.

We're sick and tired of trying to explain.
That it's a life it's not a game.
The need to be will never wane.
We're warriors, warriors.

Rebel Inside, rebel for life.
Rebel Inside.

We'll never bend or bow we'll be
Always unbroken can't you see
We deal in steel and liberty.
We're immortalized, immortalized.

Realize it's not just how we are.
It's in our blood to seek the stars.
The crimson red will take us far.
We're immortalized, immortalized.

Rebel Inside, rebel for life.
Rebel Inside.

A battle with pride and ego.
A journey that started long ago.
Life time of passion and war.
Rebel Inside.

Legends in our lifetime.
We have our hearts set in the past.
And eyes towards the future.
Rebel Inside.

Rebel Inside, rebel for life.
Rebel Inside, rebel for life.
Rebel Inside, rebel for life.
Rebel Inside, rebel for life.

"Natural High"

Last night I had a vivid dream
I found a place where nothing's what it seems
I'm bound to walk this earth alone
I am a hunter and the heir to the throne

The chase of blood and sweet revenge
It keeps on hammering in my head
The urge to kill is getting stronger
I'm south of heaven, north of hell
My final place to rest

Surrender your soul
Surrender your pride
Please enter my dream
Find your natural high
You've got nothing to fear
Cause your rebirth is near

The battle rages deep inside
No where to run for my eternal bride
And when the darkness comes around
I come alive cause, glorious we, by blood I am bound

I taste your blood so bitter sweet
Come ease my pain get on your knees
You know throughout is meant to be
Forever missed out what it seems
This is your final scream

Surrender your soul
Surrender your pride
Please enter my dream
Find your natural high
You've got nothing to fear
Cause your rebirth is near

So you are born again
To a higher plane
In my dark lair you're part of the game
Forever we are, forever we'll be
We're forever free

Surrender your soul
Surrender your pride
Please enter my dream
Find your natural high
You've got nothing to fear
Cause your rebirth is near

"Dark Wings, Dark Words"

It's been a long cold winter, widespread snowfall, raging storms
Caught in winds delusions, of our heart and soul
He came down from the mountains, into our own frozen world
Spoke of revolution, fed us with his words
A sacred man, from the other side
He gave us something to believe in
How could we be so blind?

His right hand gave us freedom, while the other stole the pride
Thought he had the answers, standing by his side
Tales of a world, not so far away
We got entangled in his vows
How could we be so blind?

When the sun and moon unite
Fear Dark Winged messenger, dread his darkened words

A graven image shattered, a meltdown of our wonderland
As the sun raised slowly, we tried to understand
A sacred heart, lost prosperity
But we found a way back home
From dusk came clarity

When the sun and moon unite
Fear the Dark Winged messenger, dread his darkened words

When the sun and moon unite
Fear the Dark Winged messenger, dread his darkened words

"Howlin' With The 'Pac"

There is a crying in the nightfall.
There is a howling in the wind.
And when the urge is getting stronger.
We hit the streets, the city calls.
The night is free for all.
We rule the dark and we do as we please.
And nothing can stop us.
No time to catch some Z's.

Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Fighting for the right to be.
Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Templars of the first degree.

We never minded any warnings.
Or asked directions from the stars.
And when the moon stops it's ascending.
We feel the rush, the inner glow.
The crimson will flow.
We have the might, and the power to succeed
And nothing can stop us.
'Cause we're the restless breed.

Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Fighting for the right to be.
Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Templars of the first degree.

And when our allegiance is falling down.
We will crawl back from hell.
Reclaim the crown.
The sign is shining for us.
Its glow will lead us on our way.
When we are led astray.
No, no!

We rule the dark and we do as we please.
And nothing can stop us.
No time to catch some Z's.

Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Fighting for the right to be.
Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Templars of the first degree.

Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Fighting for the right to be.
Howlin' With The 'Pac.
Templars of the first degree.

"Shadow Empire"

As I open up my eyes.
I see a face I don't recognize.
If the mirror tells the truth.
Then who the hell am I?
I scan the surface I am low.
What arises from above.
Everything I can't detect.
Not a thing I will deflect.

Countdown, I'm coming through.
And the vengeance, and the taker.
And the one, that shining sun.

Shadow Empire.
Shadow Empire.
The rise of the machine.
Shadow Empire.
Shadow Empire.
They rise up from the graves, to steal our dreams.

I see the world in infrared.
Hear the voices of the dead.
I'm half man and half machine.
The essence of your dream.
Soon the judgement bell will toll.
We'll take back everything they stole.
And then judge the hammer fall.
Liberty and metal for all.

Countdown, your time has come.
And the vengeance, you're in danger.
You're the one, let justice be done.

Shadow Empire.
Shadow Empire.
The rise of the machine.
Shadow Empire.
Shadow Empire.
They rise up from the graves, to steal our vivid dreams.

In my heart there is always winter.
Can not rest until I found the master key.
The master key of trust.
In my mind the arctic wind blows.
Can not sleep I can not rest before the dawn brings back the light.
Light of day.

Shadow Empire.
Shadow Empire.
The rise of the machine.
Shadow Empire.
Shadow Empire.
They rise up from the graves, to steal our vivid dreams.

"Carved In Stone"

There's silence, in the dark.
There's the fire, ready to start.
Stone pages, inked by fury.
The exception of the damned.

They are calling, out my name.
Come join us and carry the flame.
Our precious time, is standing still.
When the future meets the past.

No freedom, no glory.
There's no future, no past.

This will be our one last wish, one last dream.
When you follow the masses, or follow your own.
One last chance, one last dream.
Before your future will be, Carved In Stone.

I remember, what they said.
I still hear them, inside me head.
The legions of damnation.
They keep calling out my name.

The wind blows, forever.
But the time standing still.

This will be our one last wish, one last dream.
When you follow the masses, or follow your own.
One last chance, one last dream.
Before your future will be, Carved In Stone.

Knock, knock on my door.
Please revoke what you're asking for.

One last wish, one last dream.
When you follow the masses, or follow your own.
One last chance, one last dream.
Before your future will be...

One last wish, one last dream. (Carved In Stone)
When you follow the masses, or follow your own.
One last chance, one last dream. (Carved In Stone)
Before your future will be, Carved In Stone.

"Genocide"

Once there was a time when we were standing
Back to back against the whole conception
Once we had it all the world was our pleasure dome

Times were changing fast, our dreams were fading
Black, the darkness fell on our creation
Time was running out, we were falling one by one

We live by honour - We fight for freedom
We die but you can't slay our pride

[Chorus:]
Behind these walls, we deem, take a hold of the dream
To live our lives as we please - Metal Genocide
No fear, we know the end is near
One day we will retaliate - Genocide

Fall, mighty Babylon, your might is declining
Fast, you're on your knees repent your sinning
Fall beyond the realms of hell, we are born again

We live by honour - We fight for freedom
We die but you can't slay our pride

"Titan"

The gate is closed, the sky is burning.
Dark clouds of claw set in.
A world at war, no revelation could help predict a mankind fall.
Somewhere above, the unpolluted skies, we'll be resurrected.
What have we done? We payed the highest price.
No shelter for the undeserving masses.

Standing in line for a final journey.
Into space and beyond.
A final sigh, a breath of hope we gather, heed the eternal call.
Counting the stars, we pull the shortest straw, life is fading rapidly.
Nothing remains, a withered devil's claw.
Soul survivors picking up the pieces.

Titan.
Even the dark has a silver lining.
Titan.
Shining bright so far beyond the sun.

So this is a new beginning.
So far away, so far away.

We leave the past behind us.
No turning back, no turning back.

Titan.
Even the dark has a silver lining.
Titan, Titan.
Shining bright so far beyond the sun.
Titan.
Even the dark has a silver lining.
Titan, Titan.
Shining bright so far beyond the sun.

We will fly.
We're flying into space.
Fly, fly away.
We're flying into space.
