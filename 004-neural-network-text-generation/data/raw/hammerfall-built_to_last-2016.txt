"Bring It!"

Your words of slander won't take us down
We see right through you, a shattered clown
We walk the walk and we talk the talk
We'll back it up if you wanna rock

We'll give you action to back these words
We'll write the songs that are still unheard
And at the dawn of the new crusade
You're at a standstill beneath the blade

No matter what they will say
Forever we march our own way
We're in this together, we're fighting to win
For better or worse by the virtue of sin

Bring it - just bring it
Bring it - just bring it

You cast your spell with a serpent's tongue
Through rage and fire, you walk among
Your tainted magic wee see right through
Time to retreat, from our point of view

Come join our mighty parade
The future is ours to invade
Cause you heard the warnings, the reason, our cause
G.Y.D.U. this is our call to arms

Bring it - just bring it
Bring it - just bring it
Bring it - just bring it
Bring it - just bring it

Time to step down from your throne
Free of sin? Please cast the first stone

Bring it - Just bring it
Bring it - Just bring it
Bring it - Just bring it
Bring it - Just bring it

Just bring it

"Hammer High"

Hammer high this is a freedom cry!
Hammer high, no one should ask me why!
It's my life – tell me I will defy!
Hammer high until I die!

Black clouds on the horizon
Dread crimson skies
The thunder within
The sign to begin
A tempest of fire and ice
I keep my courage blazing
Withhold this grounds
Protecting the steal
This is my deal
The flames of thy anger and my will!

Remember the frozen tears
Turning each second to ears
I meltdown in paradise
Revolution calling! Break the ice!

Hammer high this is a freedom cry!
Hammer high, no one should ask me why!
It's my life – tell me I will defy!
Hammer high until I die!

The rapid fire pounding
To the beat of my heart
Let's make a stand
True to till the end
Warrior under command

I'm melting the frozen ice
Burning the books filled with lies
And inside the pouring rain
Things will never ever be the same!

Hammer high this is a freedom cry!
Hammer high, no one should ask me why!
It's my life – tell me I will defy!
Hammer high until I die!

The strong will survive
In the end, it's the game
Forever defy!
Hammer high up in the sacred sky!

Hammer high this is a freedom cry!
Hammer high, no one should ask me why!
It's my life – tell me I will defy!
Hammer high until I die!

Hear me now this is a freedom cry
It's my life – no one should ask me why!
Hammer high I look up fallen die!
Will defy until I die!

Hammer high this is a freedom cry!
Hammer high, no one should ask me why!
It's my life – tell me I will defy!
Hammer high until I die!

"The Sacred Vow"

Somewhere in the alley
A shot inside the dark
The gutters paved in blackened blood
By the godless patriarch

You hear the thunder howlin'
You fear his glowing eyes
A bang across the universe
As the lightning hits the skies

Fear the sound of metal
The clash when steel meets steel
We're renegades, let's regulate
Let's finish this ordeal

We are defenders, the almighty
We stomp the trail where no one dares to go
We are the brave, let's keep on fighting
Protect the sacred vow

Trapped into a corner
Silence fills the air
The dark abandoned city streets
Is now the dragon's lair

A scream across the heavens
A sound to heed the call
Protectors of the universe
Ready to play ball

Fear the sound of metal
The sweetest sound of all
We're flying high up in the sky
A mighty fireball

We are defenders, the almighty
We stomp the trail where no one dares to go
We are the brave, let's keep on fighting
Protect the sacred vow

The first cut spilled blood in the gutter
The second cut blinded his eyes
The third cut gave us all the answers
The final cut sliced up his lies

We are defenders, the almighty
We stomp the trail where no one dares to go
We are the brave, let's keep on fighting
Protect the sacred vow

We are defenders, the almighty
We stomp the trail where no one dares to go
We are the brave, let's keep on fighting
Protect the sacred vow

"Dethrone And Defy"

The hammer is pounding
When all the steel begins to glow
The fire is burning
It keeps the cauldron boiling slow

Ashes to ashes
We'll make 'em crawl to dust
The dragon will forge the steel
In fire never-ever rust

No angels will come down
To hold this sacred ground
The anvil starts to glow
Hammer down!

Made of steel – raise your swords to the sky
Charge! In battle – dethrone and defy

Blessed by Nefarious
It'll make 'em yield, will make 'em kneel
Wizards of fire
Will cast their spells upon their steel

Striking the anvil hard
No rest from the hammers violent blow
We are the power
And you are welcome to our show

Dark angels falling down
We're waiting on the ground
The anvil starts to glow
Hammer down

Made of steel – raise your swords to the sky
Charge! In battle – dethrone and defy

So, bring it on
Fighting all for one
Tap the hammer, keep the solid pace

Oh, oh, oh…

Made of steel – raise your swords to the sky
Charge! In battle – dethrone and defy

Made of steel – raise your swords to the sky
Charge united – dethrone and defy

"Twilight Princess"

Where have I been? I don't know where to begin
Memories flash, right and painfully clash
Forever gone, my mind is clear but undone
Storms raging on, sensing the other one

Here, in the thunderous silence I sit, petrified
Knowing the Twilight Princess will come

I hear her lies, piercing through me, hypnotized
Cursing the skies, who I become, I despise
I had no choice, all is lost – can't rejoice
Nothing but noise and her sweet, sweet voice

No, as the dusk is approaching, I hear her again
It's the Twilight Princess I fear
Oh, her beauty, ethereal, out of this world
Because the Twilight Princess is here

Give me a reason, you won't give me a sign
Give me a reason to cross the line
Darkness has come
And the last rays of sunlight are gone
What matters now won't matter soon
In the light of the moon

I once was dead, time standing still and at last
Free in my head, never remember the past

I must obey, finding an innocent prey
To make the Twilight Princess smile
Always astray, need her to show me the way
It is my Twilight Princess' trial

Yes, as the dusk is approaching, I hear her again
It's the Twilight Princess I see
Oh, her beauty, ethereal, out of this world
Because the Twilight Princess is me

She's always with me

"Stormbreaker"

The dragon awakes the guardian waiting around
Once touched by fire, the flame kissed this dangerous ground

Cause by lust the creature slaughtered human race
Once defended to become a state of grace

We are the Crusaders
Blood-red cross caretakers
Allied as one, known as Stormbreaker

In the Dark Ages when mankind gave birth to the beast
The demons and wizards united rejected priest

All invoked the power of king Lucifer
To infuse the power from the crucifer

We are the Crusaders
Blood-red cross caretakers
Allied as one, known as Stormbreaker

Out of the ashes they summoned the brave to fight back
To bring the evil down the best way was sold attack

To avoid repeating history once more
We must slay the dragon burn his guts and gore

We are the Crusaders
Blood-red cross caretakers
Allied as one, mighty storm
Call out the defender
Return the beast to sender
Hail to the king, known as Stormbreaker

"Built To Last"

Long before these walls came down
The king rejected his crown
All blasphemers stood in line
To spread their gospel and lies

But a wind of change came in from the past
The legendary…

Templars of steel – we came here to win
Never will kneel – we never give in
This is our deal – the future and past
Built to last

Templars of steel – we came here to win
Never will kneel – we never give in
This is our deal – the future and past
Built to last

Solid backbones cast in steel
We bow, but we never kneel
Welcome to thy kingdom come
The place, where we can be free

Where the eagles fly our spirits unite
Darkness turns to…

Templars of steel – we came here to win
Never will kneel – we never give in
This is our deal – the future and past
Built to last

Templars of steel – we came here to win
Never will kneel – we never give in
This is our deal – the future and past
Built to last

It's not a dream, visions you can steal
It's not a scheme, we are true to our deal

Built to – built to last
Built to – battle to the core

Built to – built to last
Built to – win this sacred war

Templars of steel – never will kneel
This is our deal – built to last
Templars of steel – never will kneel
This is our deal – built to last

Templars of steel – we came here to win
Never will kneel – we never give in
This is our deal – the future and past
Built to last

Templars of steel – our destiny's call
Never will kneel – united we fall
This is our deal – the hearts beating fast
Built to last

"The Star Of Home"

Day after day, we all try to find a way
Fighting to the brave
Keep the wicked far at bay
We ride across the battlefield
There's nothing left to find
You hear the vultures cry
Now their task in just a grind

The last sun will soon ignite!
An ever-lasting blight

We must find the Star of Home
Time will end at break of dawn
One more odyssey remain
Leave this desert plain

Destination's far away
Into universe we stray
To a place known as forever

Countdown begins
We must leave this place of sin
There's blood everywhere
When the river's running red
A vigil for the dying world
Resurrections last crusade
Fragments left of life
Shattered pieces from the blade

A deathwatch for the human race
Life's falling down from grace

We must find the Star of Home
Time will end at break of dawn
One more odyssey remain
Leave this desert plain

Destination's far away
Into universe we stray
To a place known as forever

Across the sacred universe we travel on
We'll find our remedy
Our home away from home… travel on

We must find the Star of Home
Time will end at break of dawn
One more odyssey remain
Leave this desert plain

Destination's far away
Into universe we stray
To a place known as forever

"New Breed"

We saw the lights go down
The falling of the crown
The infidels, dethroned
Climbing up from their darkened abode

Your pious words won't mend
You're not from heaven sent
You're holier-than-thou
To the swords, to the guns, we must go

And so here we stand
We're the soldiers of the promised land
We are here, so please leave us be
We're fighting to live to be free

New breed, old breed
We are all the same breed
Heavy metal running through our veins

You say we are the same
But, who you are to blame?
Our mighty swords won't rust
When your hearts made of stone turns to dust

You're not the chosen ones
You're second to the guns
Your deeds are bound to fail
Better find you own path, your own trail

And so here we stand
We're the brethren of the promised land
We are free, to follow our dreams
Protecting our lives, by all means

New breed, old breed
We are all the same breed
Heavy metal running through our veins

New breed, old breed
We are all the same breed
Heavy metal running through our veins

Warriors – hold your heads high
Glorious – high in the sky
The fire burns – deep down inside
Glory for us, nothing for thee

New breed, old breed
We are all the same breed
Heavy metal running through our veins

New breed, old breed
We are all the same breed
Heavy metal running through our
Running through our veins

"Second To None"

Returned from the dark side I found a greater truth
No doubts or delusions, no higher absolute

A walk through the ages, through history and time
I've seen all the treason, all done by mankind

I deny your illusions
Reject your forceful demands

My dreams seems so real now; they all come alive
The age of enlightenment, the power of your mind

Wheels of history turning
Re-spinning out of control

So many mountains to climb to be falsified
My spirit is second to none
And my heart can't be denied

My soul is my furnace, my never ending craze
My body is my temple a well-protected maze

False messiah, rejected
Return to your distorted prophecies

So many mountains to climb to be falsified
My spirit is second to none
And my heart can't be denied

Returned from the light side
Some answers left to find
In search of my brothers
My one of a kind

So many mountains to climb to be falsified
My spirit is second to none
And my heart can't be denied

My heart is torn between heaven and hell
Your gods are rejected
All false prophets will fall
