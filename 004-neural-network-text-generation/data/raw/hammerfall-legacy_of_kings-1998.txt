"Heeding The Call"

A flash in the night, a journey through time
the Templars are back on the streets
Guarded by prowess and the will to survive
all led by the guiding light
Angels of mercy, guardians of time
Shackled and chained through the eternal flame
the hammer will slowly arise

Heeding The Call, one and for all
never surrender, with glory we'll fall
Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight
fulfilling our fate, we are Heeding The Call

One, step ahead, revealing the past
united, together we stand
The call of the thunder, the sign to begin
this final crusade we will win

Angels of mercy, our journey must proceed
With hearts all filled up with chivalry
the lifeblood that we all need

Heeding The Call, one and for all
never surrender, with glory we'll fall
Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight
fulfilling our fate, we are Heeding The Call

Oh, oh, oh...

Heeding The Call, one and for all
never surrender, with glory we'll fall
Brothers unite, let's stand up and fight
fulfilling our fate, we are Heeding The Call

"Eternal Dark"

Living in the shadows
Live a life of sins
Now you feel the pressure
There ain't no giving in
Do you ever wander
Do you ever think
What may lie beyond you
What's the missing link

Will you enter the paradise
Will you see the light
What is your destination
Your eyes will see - eternal dark

There ain't no use behaving
Life can never change
There ain't no book to guide you
You're desperate to the range
Why do you listen
To the holy man
Sage one will take you
The only one who can

Will you enter the paradise
Will you see the light
What is your destination
Your eyes will see - eternal dark

"Legacy Of Kings"

Out in the fields
the full moon is rising
Enlightens the name on our shields
blessed with pride
Steel on our side
we're horsemen of thunder
The ground starts to shake as we ride
side by side
Stormbringer led us into the unknown
On wings of glory we will carry on
Legacy Of Kings - LEGACY OF KINGS
forever to surrvive, we're
Riding on the winds - RIDING ON THE WINDS
unchained and free, alive forevermore
Deep in the night
we circle around them
The honor compels us to fight
all for one
All hewed with steel
in the toil of the battle
Our enemies fate will reveal
and be sealed
The chill of the wind keeps on calling our names
there's no turning back now, keep hold of the flame
Legacy Of Kings - LEGACY OF KINGS
forever to surrvive, we're
Riding on the winds - RIDING ON THE WINDS
unchained and free, alive forevermore
Now we are here
and there is nothing left to fear
The secrets of steel
the path of glory will reveal
Legacy Of Kings - LEGACY OF KINGS
forever to surrvive, we're
Riding on the winds - RIDING ON THE WINDS
unchained and free, alive forevermore

"Let The Hammer Fall"

It's getting closer now
the clock strikes midnight time
It is the tolling of the judgement bell
You fear the dead of night
there ain't no place to hide
This is your point of no return
Now we are ready to strike, again
It's getting far to late, my friend
Let The Hammer Fall

We are above the law
let our power show
That we're in full control of your destiny
Now we are ready to strike, again
It's getting far to late, my friend
Let The Hammer Fall

We're getting closer now
the chill of distant eyes
Your on a dead end street into the night
Now we are ready to strike, again
It's getting far to late, my friend
Let The Hammer Fall
Let the Hammer... FALL

"Dreamland"

See the light of those who find
as time pass you by, you're still left behind
Time has come for you to see
that life is a game you'd rather play or flee
The ivory gates cast shadows, might betray
surrender this night, or choose my way

Come with me, I'll take you there
to the land of make belive
Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie
On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty
with the power of the steel
with the power of the steel
with the power of the steel
Dreamland will reveal

All you see is black or white
you have to spell out what's wrong or right
Spoken words may have let you down
it's time to stand up and rise with the sun
You entered the gates and there's nothing left to fear
but don't let the matter stand, you're near

Come with me, I'll take you there
to the land of make belive
Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie
On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty
with the power of the steel
with the power of the steel
with the power of the steel
Dreamland will reveal

Let me know if you wanna go, there's a place for you and me
Let me take you to the temple of your heart, let me know
You entered the gates and there's nothing left to fear
but don't let the matter stand, you're near

Come with me, I'll take you there
to the land of make belive
Let us fly beyond our dreams, fall into reverie
On the wings of destiny, I will claim our liberty
with the power of the steel
with the power of the steel
with the power of the steel
Dreamland will reveal

"Remember Yesterday"

Can you tell me why
it seems so hard to carry on
When you hear a voice
from long ago, so bittersweet
Even though I try, I can not
read between the lines
You know I tried,
Oh, yes, I tried, what's wrong
Too late to turn back time
To look over my shoulder
Maybe one day I'll return again

Remember Yesterday
and think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday
don't leave me with the sorrow
Cause I have to live today
Every morning I awake
to see the newborn day
To carry on the flame
until the end of time
Too late to turn back time
To look over my shoulder
Maybe one day I'll return again

Remember Yesterday
and think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday
don't leave me with the sorrow
Cause I have to live today
Oh, oh, oh, don't you step aside
and pretend about the future
Oh, oh, oh, never live a lie
don't you know tomorrow never comes

Remember Yesterday
and think about tomorrow
But you have to live today
Oh, lonely yesterday
don't leave me with the sorrow
Cause I have to live today
Oh, oh, oh, don't you step aside
and pretend about the future
Oh, oh, oh, never live a lie
don't you know tomorrow never comes

"At The End Of The Rainbow"

As long as I remember
We've marched across this land
Oh, oh...
Reached for a new horizon
Pulled by the killing hand

Oh, oh...
All fed up with lies
The time has come
To break these chains and fly
Here we stand, bound forevermore
We're out of this world, until the end
Here we are, mighty, glorious
At The End Of The Rainbow
With gold in our hands

We know the treasure lies
Beyond the pouring rain
Oh, oh...
Our quest will last forever
For you it's all the same

Oh, oh...
No one can deny
Our future's set
To reach above the sky
Here we stand, bound forevermore
We're out of this world, until the end
Here we are, mighty, glorious
At The End Of The Rainbow
With gold in our hands

Let's fly away through the rain
Fly high, to ease the burning pain
Oh, the colours fading out
The light is shining in the night
It's up to you, it's worth the fight
Search before the colours fade
Here we stand bound forevermore
We're out of this world, until the end
Here we are, mighty, glorious
At The End Of The Rainbow
With gold in our hands

"Back To Back"

They came at dawn into the morning light
black shadows riding on the mist
Prepered for battle, swords were shining bright
filled with anger and harm
Came to kill not to charm
The sound of metal screaming in the air
the time has come were justice rules
The endless victims looking up in fear
Now, who are the fools
Oh, here they come, riders of the sun
And they will fight ... Back To Back
They're fighting hard, their way to victory
dead bodies lying on the ground
They are the soldiers of eternity
and their swords spinning around
Oh, here they come, riders of the sun
And they will fight ... Back To Back
Kill with power, ready to ride, let's go
They got it all, they'll never fall
But they will fight
The night is falling, light will disappear
a magic silence fills the place
Could read the warning, shining crystal clear
now they were lost for the chase
Oh, here they come, riders of the sun
And they will fight ... Back To Back
No, no, no ,no

"Stronger Than All"

Always standing proud, we know our time has come
Marching off to war, the crusade has just begun
Fighting for the right to live under the sun
We won't stop 'til they've lost and we've won

Come and fly with us, together as one we belong
This magic of metal unites us, it's making us strong

Like an arrow we strike - stronger than all
Heavy metal troops on the rise
Like an arrow of might - stronger than all
We'll walk through fire, we're true to ourselves and our lives
History commits the oath to deal in steel
Warriors of the faith, to no living soul we kneel
Born into the fold, the Templars are for real
No one will ever bring us to heel

Come and fly with us, together as one we belong
This magic of metal unites us, it's making us strong

Like an arrow we strike - stronger than all
Shooting through the air at full speed
Like an arrow of might - stronger than all
In the name of metal, defending our hopes and beliefs
The past and the present unites in us all, we stand up for our beliefs
The way of the Templars is here once again, forever they will be free

Like an arrow we strike - stronger than all
Heavy metal troops on the rise
Like an arrow of might - stronger than all
We'll walk through fire, we're true to ourselves
Like an arrow we strike - stronger than all
Shooting through the air at full speed

Like an arrow of might - stronger than all
In the name of metal, defending our hopes and beliefs

"Warriors Of Faith"

They search the desert plains
in the land of no return
To seek out the danger, time to burn
They are the rightous ones
they've come to claim this land
Like warriors under command
They fight for gold and glory
proclaim the dead man's land
Into the dungeons they must go
to find the answers, left untold
Under the burning sun
in danger, eye to eye
They all now that someone must die
Into the well they're falling
past immortality
Led by temptation and devotion
rendered deathless by the touch of the sword
Onwards victory, let us hear your battle cry
the enemies, will renounce or die
Hail the Warriors Of Faith
Together they march through the fire
Forever they're lost in this world
Onwards victory, let us hear your battle cry
the enemies, will renounce or die
Eternally, they will fall under the sign
of victory, fighting all for one
Hail the the Warriors Of Faith

"The Fallen One"

I saw your face in the morning sun
Oh, I thought you were there
I heard your voice as the wind passed me by
Silently, whispering my name

So many things that I wanted to say
Forever left untold
I still remember the tears that you shed
Over someone else

Our love could never die
All I can do is cry
Save a little prayer for the fallen one

There is a light down at memory lane
Slowly fading away
Still holding on to the dreams torn apart
I will follow my heart

Our love could never die
All I can do is cry
Save a little prayer for the fallen one

Still on my own, chasing the sun
Of a time long ago
The shade in my heart, tearing apart
Everything that I long for

I saw your face in the morning sun
Oh, I thought you were there
I heard your voice as the wind passed me by
Whispering my name

Our love could never die
All I can do is cry
Save a little prayer for the fallen one
