"Secrets"

Charge into the vein
Like a needle for the pain
Thunderbolts clashing down
A new sound across the land

Force we are the pawns
Conveying a new dawn
Hear the screams, feel the force
In a symphony of steel

Across the universe
Embracing all mankind

There's something in our hearts worth fighting for
Some Secrets better left untold
And when the time has come for us to die
We'll take the Secrets to the grave

No, here they stand
The resistance, hand in hand
When you think we are gone
We will rise a brand new dawn

Across the universe
Embracing all mankind

There's something in our hearts worth fighting for
Some Secrets better left untold
And when the time has come for us to die
We'll take the Secrets to the grave

Charge, hear the screams
It's the fear of the unseen
Force, no remorse
It's a symphony of steel

Across the universe
Embracing all mankind
You can't break a metal heart
And it's far too wild to tame

There's something in our hearts worth fighting for
Some Secrets better left untold
And when the time has come for us to die
We'll take the Secrets to the grave

"Blood Bound"

Countdown, descending down to zero
Bursting into flames
Can't you see the coming of a hero
On this enchanting day

So stand up and be counted
In the solar glance in the desert sand
No longer the hunted
United we are 'till the day we fall

A chain unbreakable
Every link is allied to our mighty vow

We're Blood Bound - We aim for the sun
The luminous moon will take us high over ground
We're Blood Bound - Collecting the stars
We hold a power that is greater than all
We're Blood Bound

Watch out, the heathen's all around us
Always watch you back
We've got a lust for freedom
Whatever they say we know we'll stay

We are indestructible
And no matter what happens we will rise above

We're Blood Bound - We aim for the sun
The luminous moon will take us high over ground
We're Blood Bound - Collecting the stars
We hold a power that is greater than all
We're Blood Bound

Look into my eyes
Tell me what is hidden deep inside
Chains about to break
It's the everlasting freedom for us all

We're Blood Bound - We aim for the sun
The luminous moon will take us high over ground
We're Blood Bound - Collecting the stars
We hold a power together

We're Blood Bound - We aim for the sun
The luminous moon will take us high over ground
We're Blood Bound - Collecting the stars
We hold a power together - Blood Bound
Power forever - Blood Bound
Power - We're Blood Bound

"Fury Of The Wild"

Sighs - The fury has electrified my mind
Sighs - The hatred burns inside by the mark of vengeance I will grind

Sighs - The sound of metal falling to the ground
Sighs - By blood we will unite by blood we are forever bound

Vengeance calling me
Oh, please set me free
The Fury of the Wild
Locked up in this cage
Can't you feel the rage?
The Fury of the Wild

Sighs - Your silence will not sanctify your crime
Sighs - When revolution calls I will be the first in line

Vengeance calling me
Oh, please set me free
The Fury of the Wild
Locked up in this cage
Can't you feel the rage?
The Fury of the Wild

Now as you stand on your own
With the future, face to face
Take a look at me now
Feel the fury, taste my rage
Come taste my revenge

Unbent - Unbowed - Unbroken

Vengeance calling me
Oh, please set me free
The Fury of the Wild
Locked up in this cage
Can't you feel the rage?
The Fury of the Wild

"Hammer Of Justice"

You see me but I'm not there
Like the calm before the storm
You hear me, I'm everywhere
In the wind and in the rain

Feel me in every breeze
I'm the chill inside your spine
I'm burning you start to freeze
As you slowly turn around

And down in your hole
Solitary darkness rule
You are forlorn
Cause justice will be mine

Prowling the night
Justice calling - We'll track you down
Justice calling - Ready to strike
Justice calling - Breaking the chains
Hammer of Justice seeking his revenge

Dead man walking by
There's a void inside his eyes
Judgement, a final sigh
Here the screams electrified

As the mirror turns blank
And your essence fades away
Your chapter's closed
Sealed with thunderbolts

Prowling the night
Justice calling - We'll track you down
Justice calling - Ready to strike
Justice calling - Breaking the chains
Strike with the Hammer of Justice
Justice calling - We'll track you down
Justice calling - Ready to strike
Justice calling - Breaking the chains
Hammer of Justice seeking his revenge

I see the injustice everywhere I go
I search for tomorrow and I know you will be there
The hammer of justice holds the key to the future
The bringer of sorrow is the last you'll see

Justice calling - We'll track you down
Justice calling - Ready to strike
Justice calling - Breaking the chains
Strike with the Hammer of Justice
Justice calling - We'll track you down
Justice calling - Ready to strike
Justice calling - Breaking the chains
Hammer of Justice seeking his revenge

"Never, Ever"

Sitting in my room, staring at the wall, I can't believe it's happening
Once so wonderful, now, life's a twisted kind of reality, a fantasy
Don't know where to begin

Saw your love for me vanish in a single moment of stupidity Nightmare this
may be, but it is not a dream, ooh
I want to scream; a broken heart still bleeds

Never ever talk, never ever smile
Knowing that my life won't be the same Never ever touch, never ever feel
I will never hear you call my name...again

In my dreams I see, see you come to me; a memory of times of old
Waking up, I realize Hell's as cool as ice and the touch of sin did get me in
Nothing burns like the cold
Never ever talk, never ever smile
Knowing that my life won't be the same Never ever touch, never ever feel
I will never hear you call my name
As we sin, so do we suffer
I've fallen from grace, want to turn back time and make it undone

Never ever talk, never ever smile
Knowing that my life won't be the same Never ever touch, never ever feel
I will never hear you call my name Never ever talk, never ever smile
All I see: a future full of fear Never ever touch, never ever feel
I can never whisper in your ear...I'm sorry

"Born To Rule"

Lay down your arms this night
Surrender to the power
Embracing your metal heart
On your final walk through the snow

A hammer made of steel
From the river of blood
With magic, forged in flames
Delusions, a curse of the damned

What do you see?
Imaginary visions or reality
When you're free
Then you'll see that you are bound to rule

Rule - Born - Rule
We were Born to Rule
Rule - Born - Rule
We were Born to Rule

Born to Rule - Born to Rule
We're Born to Rule forever more
Born to Rule - Born to Rule
We're Born to Rule forever

The revolution forced us all to heed the final call
And if tomorrow never comes
Then we will strike the hammer down

Rule - Born - Rule
We were Born to Rule
Rule - Born - Rule
We were Born to Rule

Born to Rule - Born to Rule
We're Born to Rule forever more
Born to Rule - Born to Rule
We're Born to Rule forever
Forever, forever Rule!

"The Templar Flame"

So where were you when darkness came to life?
Inside a dream that controlled your inner plight
Take a look at me, you've ruined what we had
Inner visions, infrared, it drives me mad

Out of control
The system mounted on the wall
For every soul there's no way out

In this world where nothing lives
The walls are caving in, life's a sin
In this world we have to give
Before we all can see The Templar Flame

Do you believe surveillance is the cure?
The remedy for our insanity
Take a look around and tell me what you see
Souls walking planlessly like you and me

In infrared
Controlling what is left to see
Awake the dead, there's no way out

In this world where nothing lives
The walls are caving in, life's a sin
In this world we have to give
Before we all can see The Templar Flame

You see the words - Speak
In infrared - Speak
You see the words
Damn the machine - Speak
Speak of the flame....The Templar Flame

Oh, oh, oh...

"Take The Black"

The moon is full you can not see
There's something in the air
Sound asleep you're into deep
Protecting your own lair

The lion roar into the night
Yet another foe to slay
Who are you that I see right through
The hunter or the pray?

Too late to hear the final warning
No one can defy the reaper
Voices - Twisted
Calling out your name
Voices - Twisted
Calling for you

Ain't no reason for the rhyme
Take the Black - Ready to attack
Take the Black
Face to face you bide your time
Take the Black - Ready to attack
Take the Black

You though you had it all in there
In your little bag of tricks
Insanity won't set you free
As you cross the river Styx

You're out of time your bridges burn
In the undying flame
We'll nail you down to the ground
For you to bear the shame

Too late to hear the final warning
No one can defy the reaper
Voices - Twisted
Calling out your name
Voices - Twisted
Calling for you

Ain't no reason for the rhyme
Take the Black - Ready to attack
Take the Black
Face to face you bide your time
Take the Black - Ready to attack

Voices - Twisted
Calling out your name
Voices - Twisted
Calling for you

Ain't no reason for the rhyme
Take the Black - Ready to attack
Take the Black
Face to face you bide your time
Take the Black - Ready to attack

Ain't no reason for the rhyme
Take the Black - Ready to attack
Take the Black
Face to face you bide your time
Take the Black - Ready to attack

"Knights Of The 21st Century"

Words unspoken, sworn in secrecy
A burning flame for the ones who believe
The prophecy

Revelations from the sun as of the moon
In seven nights we became history
The prophecy

On a cold dark night
We set our sails to search for land so far away
Searching for the truth

There's a howl in the wind
On this mystic trail of water we sail on
The source of youth

And the storm breaks loose on the seven seas
Tag on the signs on the mounting sun

Northern light is shining on for us
Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows

From the mountain side
Came a twisted wind, it brought us new insight
Whispering these words

Come in the midst you'll see
Said a voice, I thought it was the prophecy
The secrecy unheard

And on the violent sea there's tranquillity
We saw the signs on the mountain side

Northern light is shining on for us
Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows

A secret passage never to be found
In front of us a delusion of sight
The prophecy

From the mountains and the rivers down below
A silent breeze, there's a wail in the wind
The prophecy

We've come from a land so far away
We bow down to the words you pray
Storming down the mountain side
No place to go, no place to hide

Here we stand under of cover the moonlight
Oh, the prophecy was bound to fail
Here we are, nowhere to be found
We're trapped in another world and the journey's just begun

Ah, ah, ah...

Northern light is shining on for us
Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows

Northern light is shining on for us
Breaking the ice in search for tomorrow
Setting the sails into the future
Leave all your fears and your sorrows
