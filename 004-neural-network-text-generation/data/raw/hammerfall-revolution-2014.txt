"Hector's Hymn"

I rose from the ashes, the remains of a time set aside
The warrior of Eden, found by honor, these two words collide
On and on and on, with glory he came, he saw, he conquered
He gathered his armies, true he leads his Templars of steel
They sought out the dragon, made the enemy bleed, made them kneel
On and on and on, a legend unbent, unbowed, unbroken
On and on and on, a story us born, a legacy reborn!

Hammer high to the sky
Follow the warrior and the king
Call of Hector's Hymn
Hammer high, amplify
Hail to the warrior!
Call of Hector's Hymn

Along came the thunder and the hero was set to return
We're haunted by fire, our spirit is now set to burn
On and on and on, the fire and the flame will burn forever
Still guarded by Templars, all the secrets of steel will remain
Cause we are the keepers, and for us this is real, not a game
On and on and on, we follow this need, we came, we conquered
On and on and on, together we fight, together we will fall

Hammer high to the sky
Follow the warrior and the king
Call of Hector's Hymn
Hammer high, amplify
Hail to the warrior!
Call of Hector's
Call of Hector's Hymn

Hammer high to the sky
Follow the warrior and the king
Call of Hector's Hymn
Hammer high, amplify
Hail to the warrior!
Call of Hector's Hymn

"(r)Evolution"

Heed the words, my son
Here is where my journey ends
I pass my legacy, for you to carry on

You are the future, I am the past
These words of wisdom might be my very last

The insurrection will show your direction
After years of deceit
The future’s in deadlock the peal of the death clock
A red-blooded brick in the wall

Retrogression here in neverland
Carry through utopia

(R)EVOLUTION - RISE AND RESIST
(R)EVOLUTION - FIGHT TO EXIST
(R)EVOLUTION - A WRECKING BALL
(R)EVOLUTION - FREE FOR ALL

Years of oppression, dark agony
No evolution, the unborns dim destiny

Retaliation unite our nations
All give heed to the call
You’re the selected, preferred and elected
A red-blooded brick in the wall

Wave your banners here in neverland
Speak up for utopia

(R)EVOLUTION - RISE AND RESIST
(R)EVOLUTION - FIGHT TO EXIST
(R)EVOLUTION - A WRECKING BALL
(R)EVOLUTION - FREE FOR ALL

Cause no sticks and stones
Could ever break my bones
Nor their words
Could ever quench my soul

(R)EVOLUTION - RISE AND RESIST
(R)EVOLUTION - FIGHT TO EXIST
(R)EVOLUTION - A WRECKING BALL
(R)EVOLUTION - FREE FOR ALL

(R)EVOLUTION - RISE AND RESIST
(R)EVOLUTION - FIGHT TO EXIST
(R)EVOLUTION - A WRECKING BALL
(R)EVOLUTION - FREE FOR ALL

"Bushido"

Screaming and twisting
He's pounding his sword to the ground
A soul made of fire
A heart made of solid steel, fear the sound

Guided by courage
The fear of eternal disgrace
The spirits of daring
The trail of his life brought fail to embrace

Trapped in the corner, hell or paradise
Forever failure or self-sacrifice

I'M A WARRIOR, I AM
In the rising sun I stand
MY TRUE COLOURS SHINING BRIGHT
INSIDE AEONIAN FLAMES

Winding and turning
He's seeking a path to survive
The hunter's the hunted
The spectre within will soon come alive

The spirit of bearing by seven diverges unite
Never surrender, be ready to kill
When killing is right

Shame and dishonor, the wrath of the sword
Beyond all bearings, the honor restored

I'M A WARRIOR, I AM
In the rising sun I stand
MY TRUE COLOURS SHINING BRIGHT
INSIDE AEONIAN FLAMES

I'M A WARRIOR, I AM
I'm a soldier under command
IN THE SETTING SUN I'LL CARRY ON
The code of the warrior soul

Honour, courage and rectitude
Tempered by ancient wisdom
One law, one life in solitude
Live by the code, die by the sword

I'M A WARRIOR, I AM
IN THE RISING SUN I STAND
MY TRUE COLOURS SHINING BRIGHT
INSIDE AEONIAN FLAMES

I'M A WARRIOR, I AM
In the rising sun I stand
MY TRUE COLOURS SHINING BRIGHT
INSIDE AEONIAN FLAMES

I'M A WARRIOR, I AM
I'm a soldier under command
IN THE SETTING SUN I'LL CARRY ON
The code of the warrior soul

This is the way!

"Live Life Loud"

Many times this story has been told
A legendary tale, a fable, brave and bold

Now your blood begins to boil
Turn the crank of all the toil
Raise your fist and yell, born again

LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD

Caught up in a maze nowhere to go
Suppressed by powers endless deep of pain and woe

Come on, break your inner chains
Feel the power in your veins
Raise your fist and yell, born again

LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD

Now your blood begins to boil
Turn the crank of all the toil
Raise your fist and cry out loud, born again

LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD

LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD
LIVE LIFE LOUD

LIVE LIFE LOUD

"Ex Inferis"

On a dusty shelf, buried over ground
In the corner of the attic
Where the bats come out and play

Oh, they linger on
Preserved, embraced in silence
A script, a tale, kept from the light of day

The fear of God
A recital of a story only for the strong to find

As you kneel down, you feel the cold wind blow
Kill the switch, lock all the exits
The curse, the spell, the words begin to glow

The sun is silent
Nine circles, the passage into the abyss

EX INFERIS, REMEMBER MY NAME
EX INFERIS, DEMON FROM HELL

Abandon hope as you step inside
The rebellion of angels
Who reside these darkened shores

Oh, waist deep in ice
Surrounded by the fire
The purgatory gate, nowhere to go

This is your calling
Malicious and violent, the circles of hell

Limbo, lust and gluttony
Rage out of control
Greed and anger, heresy
The price to cleanse thy soul

EX INFERIS, REMEMBER MY NAME
EX INFERIS, DEMON FROM HELL
EX INFERIS, REMEMBER MY NAME
EX INFERIS, DEMON FROM HELL

All for one, but none for all
Enslaved, we will succumb
Violence, fraud, no kingdome come
Reborn in treachery

EX INFERIS, REMEMBER MY NAME
EX INFERIS, DEMON FROM HELL
EX INFERIS, REMEMBER MY NAME
EX INFERIS, DEMON FROM HELL

EX INFERIS

"We Won't Back Down"

Silence, we have sworn
The oath, protect the earth, the sun and moon
My precious friends
United we stand ’till the end

The vision, future’s demand
Has been written in the palm of our hands
When we charge the storm clouds amass
Cause the ace of swords will lead on this glorious day

HOLD YOUR HEADS HIGH
REACH FOR THE SKY
NEVER SURRENDER
WE WON'T BACK DOWN
THE POWER WITHIN
OUR REMEDY FOR SIN
THE TRUE LIFE DEFENDERS
WE WON'T BACK DOWN

Battles, we have won
We bled, but never once we’ve fallen down
Form dusk ’till dawn
Standing with our mighty swords drawn

The future lies straight ahead
Our dreams within reach, not mislead
We are here, true warriors on the line
Forever we’ll be the sun in the tarot deck of cards

HOLD YOUR HEADS HIGH
REACH FOR THE SKY
NEVER SURRENDER
WE WON'T BACK DOWN
THE POWER WITHIN
OUR REMEDY FOR SIN
THE TRUE LIFE DEFENDERS
WE WON'T BACK DOWN

Cause the ace of swords will lead on this glorious day

HOLD YOUR HEADS HIGH
REACH FOR THE SKY
NEVER SURRENDER
WE WON'T BACK DOWN
THE POWER WITHIN
OUR REMEDY FOR SIN
THE TRUE LIFE DEFENDERS
WE WON'T BACK DOWN
WE WON'T BACK DOWN
WE WON'T BACK DOWN

We won't back down, we are partners in crime
We are true life defenders on earth

"Winter Is Coming"

The passion of broken hearts, the passion of pain
Flames of the mortal world, the fire still burns

Out of the dark, the winter is coming

The passion of broken souls, their passion is pain
Forever crying, forever dead

OUT OF THE DARK, THE WINTER IS COMING
OUT OF THE DARK, THE WINTER IS NEAR

I am lost in confusion
I am trapped between worlds
I’m a wolf on the prowl in the night
Take the black, you win or you die

First of the ancient men, the bloodline is strong
A star from beyond the wall will rescue us all?

OUT OF THE DARK, THE WINTER IS COMING
OUT OF THE DARK, THE WINTER IS HERE

"Origins"

Once upon a time not far away
We all swore the oath to seize the day
Moving on at the speed of light
Still united, undivided

We’re brothers in arms searching for gold and glory
Stay true to your heart, come follow, heed the call
But nothing’s forever, no nothing at all

Come inside, true templars of the world
Raise your voice, let’s speak for the unheard
On and on the story must go on
Running free we always will be

We are what we are and we always strive for glory
Together as one we shine like the sun
Beyond the divine we’re soaring

SHINING ON SO GLORIOUS, THE BLOODLINE OF TRUE WARRIORS
FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT TO BE; PART OF THE LEGACY

SEARCHING FOR THE RAINBOW'S END
THE GOLD AWAITS FOR YOU MY FRIEND
COURAGE IS YOUR GUIDING STAR
AND IT WILL TAKE YOU FAR

SHINING ON SO GLORIOUS, THE BLOODLINE OF TRUE WARRIORS
FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT TO BE; PART OF THE LEGACY

SEARCHING FOR THE RAINBOW'S END
THE GOLD AWAITS FOR YOU MY FRIEND
COURAGE IS YOUR GUIDING STAR
AND IT WILL TAKE YOU FAR

"Tainted Metal"

Hear the screams from down below
The cry of the raven, the demons and wizards
In league with the dark

Feed the fire nourish the flames
The hammer is pounding the steel in its grace
By via crucis, embraced

Born out of wedlock, the spirit is lost
Ordeal of ingestion, the way of the cross

OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL
TAINTED METAL

No return nowhere to go
The wands of the wizards call demons to fetter
Their heart broken souls

Face the fire, defiling the steel
The blood of the heathens, their guts and their gore
Weakens the sword to the core

Born out of wedlock, the future came fast
Trial by fire, iconoclast

OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL
TAINTED METAL
OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL
TAINTED METAL
BLACKENS THE POWER OF STEEL

Born out of wedlock, the spirit is lost
Ordeal of ingestion, ordeal of the cross

OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL
TAINTED METAL
OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL
TAINTED METAL
BLACKENS THE POWER OF STEEL

Oh...

OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL

OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL

OH IT'S...
TAINTED METAL

"Evil Incarnate"

Who’s there
Walking the shadows I fear
I am in deep
The nightmares they won’t disappear
Leave me alone

Lay down
Lay down your arms on the ground
You’ve been sent here
To champion for the unbound, yeah

Satan's scheme falls into place
An evil grin upon his face

No fear
The duels about to begin
I’ve got a black hand
The hand of the dead man can win, yeah

Satan slips another ace
A thousand souls will fall from grace

EVIL INCARNATE, THE SON OF MAN
LOST TO THE GREAT DECEIVER
EVIL INCARNATE, I FAILED THE PLAN
A NEW INCEPTION REIGNS

EVIL INCARNATE, THE SON OF MAN
LOST TO THE GREAT DECEIVER
EVIL INCARNATE, I FAILED THE PLAN
A NEW INCEPTION REIGNS

"Wildfire"

WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE

I am the one running out of control
I am faster than the speed of light
There is a darkness surrounding my life
And its claws gotta hold of my sight

I’m leaving the past behind, wander off into the wild
Pin down my future at last, moving on nowhere fast

LIKE A WILDFIRE
WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE

Hellbent for metal it clouded my mind
Like a force of destruction and rage
Possessed by possessions, it all choked me up
I must fly bursting out of my cage

I’m free, set at liberty, no chains are pinning me down
My scornful eye takes me places, no one dares to go

LIKE A WILDFIRE
WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE
WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE

Bathe in the rays of the sun
Feeding my inner flame
Why are we wasting our time
Watching horizons go down
Standing there patient in one fine line

WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE
WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE - WILDFIRE

"Demonized"

So here I am once more, the devil in disguise
You've seen me before
I stray the earth alone, across the seven seas
To settle the score

I stand behind, I am your dark reflection
Last thing you see when you die

DEMONIZED
POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL, I'M IN DISGUISE
A BLACK-HEARTED SOUL SCREAMING ALL BUT LIES
WELCOME TO ENTER MY FINAL MASS
A SINISTER SNAKE IN THE GRASS

So many times before
I've seen the world go down
By the touch of my hand
So if you wanna fly, wanna fly across the sky
To find the promised land

Your wings will burn
There's nothing left above us
A paradise lost to my crown
You spread your wings, melting in the sunlight
The fear of the future, hands down

DEMONIZED
POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL, I'M IN DISGUISE
A BLACK-HEARTED SOUL SCREAMING ALL BUT LIES
WELCOME TO ENTER MY FINAL MASS
A SINISTER SNAKE IN THE GRASS

I'm strung-out, I am the air that you breathe
I will make you choke, addicted
I feed on your needs

DEMONIZED
POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL, I'M IN DISGUISE
A BLACK-HEARTED SOUL SCREAMING ALL BUT LIES
WELCOME TO ENTER MY FINAL MASS
A SINISTER SNAKE IN THE GRASS

DEMONIZED
POSSESSED BY THE DEVIL, I'M IN DISGUISE
A BLACK-HEARTED SOUL SCREAMING ALL BUT LIES
WELCOME TO ENTER MY FINAL MASS
A SINISTER SNAKE IN THE GRASS
