"Riders Of The Storm"

Sight a brand new horizon
Ascending from the hearts of those who couldn't see
The decline of man, the final stage of war

Spectral forces of mankind
We're all trapped inside the core of the machine
Our time has come to find a way back home

We seek our destiny in thee
In the eye of the storm
A genesis is born, reborn

Riders of the storm - one with the wind, defenders of
creation
Riders of the storm - aligned with the sun

Phantom powers rule the earth
Descending down, controlling you and me
What is left to see, is it all but a dream

On the inside looking out
Kept within a cage, behind a false facade
They can't keep us down cause our strength is our will

We dream of a genesis reborn
Where our spirits fly free
Let us choose our own destiny

Riders of the storm - one with the wind, defenders of
creation
Riders of the storm - aligned with the sun

Speak the word of Nemesis
Call for thunder call for rain
Let us meet our Genesis
Save us from the unholy pain

Riders of the storm - one with the wind, defenders of
creation
Riders of the storm - aligned with the sun

"Hearts On Fire"

We saw the writings on the wall
When heathens ruled above us all
Tormented, we still heard the call

You come to bring us down
Wield the scepter, steal the crown
Time on the throne is running out

'Cause seasons change but we are still the same
Even though the cold winds blow the fire burns inside

Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Burning for the steel

Hearts on fire

For years shunned by society
Outcasts, condemned for our beliefs
Our legions grew in secrecy

And now, the time is here
I see the Templars everywhere
The freedom call is drawing near

We hold our rebel banners up with pride
The colour's crimson and the hammer is the sign

Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire
Burning for the steel

[Solo: Stefan]

Hearts on fire, hearts on fire...

Hearts on fire, hearts on fire
Burning, burning with desire...

Hearts on fire

"On The Edge Of Honour"

Led by temptation into the underworld
to absence of season and time
Soldiers of Fortune, Soldiers of the Night
back to back, ready to fight

Enchanted gardens, where Evil slipped away
through darkness, fire and rage
Uncanny demons will dance upon your grave
as soon as you become their slave

Surrender or fight, there's nowhere to turn
The Bringer of Light, where are you now
Forever our hearts will burn

Immortal Riders, Protectors of the Earth
lost in the abode of the dead
Misled through darkness and mislead by desire
inside the midst of the fire

Surrender or fight, there's nowhere to turn
The Bringer of Light, where are you now
Forever our hearts will burn

Fallen Angels, arise from your graves
Free your spirits and unite
before the blood of the Unicorn colors the night
From the ruins of hell we shall rise
On The Edge Of Honour we see the light
of the Unicorn soaring the night

[Lead: both]

Born to conquer the fight,
here we stand with the Future in our hands
Through fire we'll rise to touch the sky

[Solo: Stefan]

Oooh...

[Lead: both]

"Crimson Thunder"

We are the voices in the dark
Inside the fire we are the
Eternal Spark that will guide the way

We are the stars up in sky
We gather winds so you can fly
We are the light when you're sleeping

All your dreams can come true
"Where do we go?"
We're just a heartbeat away

Follow the signs of the Crimson Thunder
We will stay by your side
Let our voices be there to guide you

We are forces in the rain
Inside your heart we are the
unending answer to all your fears

So take a step towards the light
The crimson sky fulfills the night
The revelation is near

All your dreams can come true
"Where do we go?"
We're just a heartbeat away

Follow the signs of the Crimson Thunder...
We will stay by your side
Let our voices be there to guide you

[Solo: Stefan]

All your dreams can come true...

Follow the signs of the Crimson Thunder...

"Trailblazers"

It's been a long way but now we are near
the midst of the fiery rain
We know the Thunder have summoned us all
to the place were innocence got slain

Behold the omens, the rivers run red
The autumn winds carry the dead
The final warning, the very last command
Shattered remains for the damned

We won't surrender
No never, we will carry on

From the Lake of Fire they have come
Fierce almighty legions, one by one
When the Flames of Glory touch the sky
Trailblazers do or die

We are the mighty, who soar through the air,
creating our own destiny
Warriors once and Warriors to be
Forever our spirits fly free

We rode on lightning we shone like the sun
in a thunderous symphony
We fought them hard we fought them so brave,
sending them back to their grave

The Hammer has fallen
The fire still burns in our hearts

From the Lake of Fire they have come
Fierce almighty legions, one by one
When the Flames of Glory touch the sky
Trailblazers do or die

[Solo: Stefan]

[Lead: both]

The visions we gazed upon,
as the nightmare returned
On the uncaring slopes
the mark of the shadows still burns

[Lead: both]

"Dreams Come True"

Never thought I'd feel again, feel the darkness
fade and see the morning sun arise
Never thought I'd feel alive again, senses dull
and blunt from all the lies

Now, when I hold your face so close to mine I
see a place where the sun will shine, with you
it is divine

Looking down into those eyes, I know, I'll be
lost and never found again. Kiss me once and
I will surely melt and die, kiss me twice and I
will never leave your side...(if) Dreams Come True

Do I dare to trust this time? Ooh, the Bells of
Fortune, will I ever hear them chime?
Only those who have been burned before truly
know the meaning of Hell's flaming core

I was the brooding night and you were dawn.
Saving me, for I was forlorn, in your light I am
reborn.

Looking down into those eyes, I know, I'll be
lost and never found again. Kiss me once and
I will surely melt and die, kiss me twice and I
will never leave your side...(if) Dreams Come True

[Lead: Oscar]

Then, when the walls are breaking down on us, when all
we see is misery
will you still believe in me?

Looking down into those eyes, I know, I'll be
lost and never found again. Kiss me once and
I will surely melt and die, kiss me twice and I
will never leave your side, until the sign of winter,
always by your side....(Dreams Come True)

"Angel Of Mercy"

There's never been any reason
or escape for the treason
You just think of a time far away
I feel your flame and your anguish
I know your plans and your last wish
You just can't face another day

Angel of Mercy, take her to your homeland
Angel of Mercy, you can feel the signs,
it's the End, it's the End

You've stood along the life line
You've played the fool for the last time
You just want the joy and the peace
You've heard all the laughter
You've seen what you're after
You just want the rest and the sleep

Angel of Mercy, take her to your homeland
Angel of Mercy, you can feel the signs,
it's the End, it's the End

Angel Of Mercy, Angel Of Mercy

[Lead: Stefan]

[Solo: Stefan]

You can hear the clock's tick
as you scheme for your last fix,
from a place you never will awake
I hear your cry into the night
I hear you die within my fright
But now you've saved your mistake

Angel Of Mercy...

Angel of Mercy, Angel of Mercy

[Solo: Stefan]

"The Unforgiving Blade"

When the sky is turning black, you fear the dawn
Your inner voice compels you, but you're all alone
Thy secret sense lies still obscure within your
shattered dreams,
and all you can do is scream

Long ago you spoke the words of heresy
Twenty years of running brings back memories
All your wisdom made me seek the truth that lied
beyond
my inner dreams

"Follow the one that fell from the crimson skies"
I remember the words, I can never forget your demise

And now your world's falling down
For all the games that you played
And as your soul's falling down
You'll meet The Unforgiving Blade

Should have seen it coming
when you rolled the dice
Deeper and deeper, falling,
away from your paradise

[Solo: Stefan]

Innocent eyes observing the Crimson Skies,
awaiting for someone to heal the burning lies

And now your world's falling down
For all the games that you played
And as your soul's falling down
You'll meet The Unforgiving Blade

And now your...

"Hero's Return"

In a time of fear and confusion,
silence charging the air
The sunlight is gone, darkness lives on
in the heart of the dragon's lair

Lost in a world of illusions
No trace of the missing ore
Stealing our souls, we're out of control,
knocking at death's door

All our beliefs fading into ashes
Heed the words that we pray

For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn
Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn

Now we charge, the battle is raging,
blood runs everywhere
Our anger is fierce, avenging the years
No time for a final prayer

Behold, the might of the hammer,
elliptical bolts of fire
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You're down to the wire

Somewhere out there lies a new tomorrow
for me and those who believe

For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn
Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn
For a Hero's Return our hearts still yearn
Rise and conquer, let the infidels burn

Oooh...

Now, I've returned from a place far beyond
My mission I set, let it be done

We still believe in a brighter future
The dreams are ours to fulfil

For a Hero's Return....
