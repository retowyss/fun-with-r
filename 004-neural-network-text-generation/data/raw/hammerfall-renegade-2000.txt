"Templars Of Steel"

The hands of time have brought you here
to make a change, to break down the walls
You are the ones and you are the only
trying to live by your own goals

And you all cry for freedom
Raise your fists to the sky

Let your voice speak for the revolution
All join forces with all the powers that you feel
Let your heart beat for the revolution
Led by the Templars of Steel

Let's spread the word of the sole survivors
with metal pounding inside their souls
The fire burns, and it will forever
blaze for the ones who stands strong

And you all cry for freedom
with your fists in the sky

Let your voice speak for the revolution
All join forces with all the powers that you feel
Let your heart beat for the revolution
Led by the Templars of Steel
You are the Templars of Steel

Oh, oh, oh ...

Let your voice speak for the revolution
All join forces with all the powers that you feel
Let your heart beat for the revolution
Led by the Templars of Steel

Let your voice speak for the revolution
All join forces with all the powers that you feel
Let your heart beat for the revolution
Led by the Templars of Steel
You are the Templars of Steel

"Keep The Flame Burning"

Standing at the
crossroads, were the future meets the past
Oh can't you feel, there's magic in the air
We're noble knights and mighty men, with the
power to assay
Faithful and true, let our deeds show you the way

Glorious, we live and we die
Our courage will unite

In our hands we hold the future, carry on
In our hearts, eternally, we Keep The Flame
Burning

Hear the sound of roaring thunder, and the sound of raging steel
In the battle of thrust our sprits will reveal

Glorious, we'd rather die
with honour than to live with shame

In our hands we hold the future, carry on
In our hearts, eternally, we keep the flame...
burning deep inside forever, shining on
And in our hearts for all eternity we Keep The
Flame Burning

We stay as we are, now the first crusade is won
Let it be written, let it be done

In our hands we hold the future, carry on
In our hearts, eternally, we keep the flame...
burning deep inside forever, shining on
And in our hearts for all eternity we Keep The
Flame Burning

"Renegade"

See the outlaw stands alone beneath the burning sun
The raging badlands now is his home
There's no sign of victory, he lost his liberty
and the only woman that he loved

An outlaw chasing outlaws, a runner in the night
By the radiant moon he will strike
The seeker of all dangers has come to take his toll
From the dead of night he will arise

Renegade, Renegade
Committed the ultimate sin
Renegade, Renegade
This time the prowler will win

He stalks in shadow lands, soundless, with gun in hand
Striking like a reptile, so fierce
No chance to get away, no time for your last prayer
When the prowler sneaks up from behind

An outlaw chasing outlaws, the hunter takes his pray
The law of the jungle he obeys
Craving for the danger to even out the scores
Face to face, once and for all

Renegade, renegade
Committed the ultimate sin
Renegade, renegade
This time the prowler will win

On through the night he rides, on his raging
horse made of steel
Nothing can save you now, before the renegade
you will kneel

Renegade, Renegade
Committed the ultimate sin
Renegade, renegade
This time the prowler will win

Renegade, Renegade
Committed the ultimate sin
Renegade, renegade
This time the prowler will win

"Living In Victory"

Do you remember how we used to say
Everything around us are made of clay
We were the Kings and the others the fools,
playing by our rules

Adorned with golden shapes and silver dreams
You count the seconds, every moment seems
like your lost to the stars up above
Eventhou you're falling

Spoken words made of trust, burning bridges
between us,
turning diamonds into rust

You're running out of time, the higher that you climb
the deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all
Out of time, on the line
Living In Victory

You spread your words, I say devoid of truth
What's left is fantasy of endless youth
You made a promise, a little white lie
Now you're falling from the sky

Chasing dragons by the moon, burning bridges around you,
your deepest fears begin to loom

You're running out of time, the higher that you climb
the deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all
Out of time, on the line
Living In Victory

Is it someone that hears you, is it somebody there
All you know and all you will get, lie so deep
down inside

Dreams of fortune in the dust, when all your
bridges are burnt,
turning being into lust

You're running out of time, the higher that you climb
the deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all
Out of time, on the line
Living in sin

Out of time, the higher that you climb
the deeper you will fall and lose sight of it all
Out of time, on the line
Living In Victory
Living In Victory

"Always Will Be"

Our sun is set, our day is done, I'm left here wondering
Is this the end, my final words to you
Day turned to night and now you're gone, I'm left here pondering
Can this be true, are we really through

You were the wind beneath my wings, taught me how to fly
With you I lived among the kings, how could this ever die

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever,
And I Always Will Be

We were one, we were all, we were the only
Future full of hope, nothing could stand in our way
But dreams can change, visions fall, I feel so lonely
I would walk through fire for just one more day

You were the angel of my life, taught me to be free
Now I'm a stranger in your eyes, walls are closing in on me

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I Always Will Be
Missing you, in my heart you are The One
And you Always Will Be

When I turn to the east, I see no dawn,
But after darkness comes the light
And when I turn to the west, the silent night hides all
Where is the light that shines so bright

So I say farewell, I'm yours forever
And I Always Will Be
Missing you, in my heart you are The One
And you Always Will Be

Nah-nah-na ... and you Always Will Be
Nah-nah-na ... and you Always Will Be
And you Always Will Be
my Little One you are
And you Always Will Be

"The Way Of The Warrior"

Our time has come, get ready fight
Sisters and brothers in metal unite
The dreams that you had are about to come true
The voice of the warrior is calling for you

Turn your own deeds to his gracious glory,
and he will make you see

This is the way we want it to be
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way we want it to be
Walking the way, the honest will see
Walking The Way Of The Warrior
Walking the way, The Way Of The Warrior

Blood-red the steel of our swords shall flow
and by the allegiance we're ready to go
Stout are the foe, in warfare so bold
Nothing can stop us, the future we hold

Brace up, defend,
never ever be outdone in bravery

This is the way we want it to be
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way we want it to be
Walking the way, the honest will see
Walking The Way Of The Warrior
Walking the way, The Way Of The Warrior

The saints and the sinners in battle so bright, as
the forces of steel will unite
The way of the warrior, the call of his life, shall
lead us all into the light

The metal crusade will conquer all
Our bonds will be stronger, see the infidels fall
Surrender your soul to the Gods of steel
In the blood of the fallen the enemies kneel

Turn your own deeds to his gracious glory,
and he will make you see
Brace up, defend,
never ever be outdone in bravery

This is the way we want it to be
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way we want it to be
Walking the way, the honest will see
Walking The Way Of The Warrior
Walking the way, The Way Of The Warrior

This is the way we want it
This is the way we need it
This is The Way Of The Warrior

This is the way we want it
This is the way we need it
This is The Way Of The Warrior
This is the way

"Destined For Glory"

Once upon a time in a forlorn land,
a man on a mission was left at fates hand
In his eyes you could see the whites turn red
Surrounded by evil, abandoned for dead

Born on the run by the sign of the sun
A mail-clad warrior, the chosen one
His name's been cursed, he is bound to fail
A wandering spirit with the will to prevail

By the sign of the moon,
he swore the oath to fight alone

Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without honor, and you're destined to
fall

He still can recall his father's words
"Don't loose your faith, let your voice be heard"
Echoes from the past will lead him on
By these words of honor, shine like the sun

By the sign of the moon
He swore the oath to fight alone

Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without honor, and you're destined to
fall
Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without soul and you will loose it all

The prophecies spoke of a wandering man
Skilled with steel, black as the night

Normally veiled from the mortal eyes
His hammer arose like a magic force
With a gaze that turned everything into stone
the warrior spoke, "I am the one"

Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without honor, and you're destined to
fall
Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without soul and you will loose it all

Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without honor, and you're destined to
fall
Fight with your heart, and you're Destined For
Glory
But fight without soul and you will loose it all

"The Champion"

Gaze upon the stake,
flames will soon start to embrace
Condemned, auto da f√©,
she's about to fall from grace

In the land of the rising sun
shadows are falling again
The die is cast, the future and past
coming to her at last

Oh, oh, oh
All she needed was a Champion
Oh, oh, oh
Crying for a saviour to fight for her life

Behold, the freedom cries
by the dying of the light
Too late to justify
for vindication upon this night

In the land of the rising sun
shadows are falling again
From out of nowhere, a rider declared
to answer her final prayer

Oh, oh, oh
He stood up to be the Champion
Oh, oh, oh
He became the saviour that fought for her life

Face to face, eye to eye
The saviour fought to save her pride
Far beyond the starlit skies, the encounter went
on

Gaze upon the stake,
as the flames start to embrace
A life, an act of faith,
long-lost gone without a trace

In the land of the rising sun
Shadows are falling again
The die is cast for the future and past
came for her at last

Oh, oh, oh
All she needed was a Champion
Oh, oh, oh
Crying for a saviour to fight for her

Oh, oh, oh
He stood up to be the Champion
Oh, oh, oh
He became the saviour that fought for her life

"A Legend Reborn"

You've been fighting for much to long
You saw the future and what to come
Restless spirits out on the run,
among the shadows of the sun

You are the rising resistance now
We've come to show you a way somehow
Beyond the past and in secrecy,
we found it all, but we want more

We come from the age of chivalry
Metal machines, unchained and free
We are hear for you to see

Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are
breaking the seal
Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the
word of a Legend Reborn

Moving silent like a gentle breeze
We're the troops of metal and we do as we
please
We are the restless, we are the wild,
burning hearts that never die

We are going against the tide
The hammer has fallen, a thorn in your side
Break the silence or take the fall
The mighty Templars will take it all

Welcome the age of chivalry,
were we all will be set free
It's the time for you and me

Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are
breaking the seal
Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the
word of a Legend Reborn

Sons and brothers fight or fall
With our sisters and daughters
We're standing one for all

Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are
breaking the seal
Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the
word of a Legend Reborn

Flying on wings of steel, thundering, we are
breaking the seal
Fighting for the oath we sworn, to spread the
word of a Legend Reborn
