"Patient Zero"

I breathe alone, my skin
begins to peel
Forsaken in my misery
to battle this ordeal

I can't resist the cravings,
no I have to ease the pain
My screaming brain is melting slowly,
turning me insane

Devastation all across the nation
Infected, but I am not alone
My days are numbered but I am a patient
From zero the counting has begun

I resist resistance, I survive the
hangman's noose
Future looks sinister,
I'm a zombie on the loose

Cuz I feed in darkness,
I feast in broad daylight
Whatever you do, better hold on
tight and stay out of my sight

Evacuation all across the nation
Infected, but I am not alone
Our days are numbered
and we are patient
To zero the countdown has begun

We exist but our hearts don't beat
The streets, our sacred haven
Fight or flee
don't waste another round

[Solo: Pontus]

We exist, but our eyes run red
The dead will feast upon you
Aiming high, don't chocke
or you'll be downed

Retribution a suicide solution
Infected but you are not alone
All lives are numbered
and we are all patient
To zero the countdown has begun

"Bang Your Head"

In 1981, the metal struck like thunder
The harmonious noise all linked in one voice
A croon across the nation

My soul was ripped and torn and I couldn't
resist the power
The music I heard, the thunderous words
My gate to liberation

It made us rock it made us lose
our self control

Bang Your Head - Stand United

It was the spark, the flame, setting our
hearts on fire
Creating our dreams, our lives
and our means
We're howling' with desire

We came to rock we came
to lose our self control

Bang Your Head - Stand United

The years kept passing by
No wind of change could bring us down
Cuz we are one my friend
We stand together 'til the end
This is our destiny
Our will, our life our honored crown
Our dreams is ours to dream
Our beat's out beat forevermore

[Solo: Pontus / Oscar / Pontus / Both]

Now, Templars, bang your heads and unite

It made us rock it made us roll forever more

Bang Your Head - Stand United
Bang Your Head - Stand United

Bang Your Head!

"One More Time"

Saints - From heaven
Hell hang-arounds - Decending
Disciples of repression
Fuse - Our evil
Exterminate - Protectors
Bringing us down to the ground
And pushing us back to the...

Final frontier, wedlock in the grime
Cry a thousand tears, battle one more time

One more time
One more time
One more time
One more time

Pray - Steel demons
Don't look away - Tormentors
Traverse the darkened heavens
Seek - Our wicked
Seek and destroy - Opponents
Soldiers of heaven and hell

Hey - We're fighting
Eye for an eye - Protecting
Our mother earth, dissecting
Break - Their evil
Ruin the core - Allegiance
Vengeance is now in our hands
Vengeance
Pushing us back to the...

Final frontier, buried in the grime
Cry a thousand tears, battle one more time

One more time
One more time

[Solo: Oscar / Pontus]

Final frontier, the judgement bell will chime
No wasted years, "stand up" one more time

One more time
One more time
One more time
One more time
One more time
One more time
One...more......time

"The Outlaw"

It started with the holy water rising to a boil
The crops went bad, no life coul breed,
beneath the rotten soil
Imprisoned for his make beliefs,
impending dire views
Became accountable for every flaw,
spreading the news

Disturbing dreams of the future - reverie
Seven flights of imagination

These taunting dreams no one could read or even understand
Desilutions of insanity banned from his fatherland
Just leave the ship and swim ashore, life's hanging by a thread
Days of mass destruction, armageddon lies ahead

Disrurbing dreams of the future - reverie
Seven flights of imagination

Bring out the Outlaw, how do you plead
To the allegation
Bring out the Outlaw, charge him, decree
Eternal damnation

So, seven years of devastation followed in the land
One for every prophecy, served by tha almighty hand
The outlaw was imprisoned for scattering his dreams
None stood up to hold his ground, spineless so it seems
Disturbing dreams of the future - reverie
Seven flights of imagination

Bring out the Outlaw, could you forsee
The allegation
Bring out the Outlaw, charge him, decree
Eternal damnation

A life could be saved, if someone stood up for his rights
Now cursed and condemned, mistreated on his last nocturnal flight

[Solo: Pontus]

Bring out the Outlaw, how do you plead
To the allegation
Bring out the Outlaw, charge him, decree
Eternal damnation

Call for the Outlaw, help us forsee
God's allegation
Call for the Outlaw, charge us, decree
Eternal damnation

"Send Me A Sign"

Snow keeps falling down
From grace in the dark
Frozen tears in silent cries

Oh, oh, oh...
Sadness, now color the battle field
All around, life passing by

Falling from my eyes
Like a raindrop from the skies
Falling from my eyes
Oh, oh...

So Send me a Sign
Just a way to explain
Tell me what I can do
I'm turning insane

So Send me a Sign
Show me what I should do
Only one wish to tell
A word sincerely signed just for you

Winter paved ny way, couldn't see nor believe
I watched the snow highlighting my grief

Oh, oh, oh...
Sadness, I long for the sun to shine
Please melt the ice wrapped around my heart

Falling from my eyes
Like a raindrop from the skies
Falling from my eyes
Oh, oh...

So Send me a Sign
Just a way to explain
Tell me what I can do
I'm turning insane

So Send me a Sign
Show me what I should do
Only one wish to tell
A word sincerely signed just for you

"Dia De Los Muertos"

Light up the candles and open the gate
The bell is ringing for the souls with no fate
Our little angels, all lost in this world

Death is transcending, they will ressurect
Not from their grave, but they've come to collect
In danza macabra, the dance of the dead

We honor the souls, we praise the departed
Now la calavera catrina is glowing
The eyes of the skull bursting into a blaze

All of the damned - dia de los muertos
All of the damned - los angelitos, los innocentes

So listen, beware,
Remember what they said
That life is best
Enjoyed after death

There is a place where the evil can rest
Let's draw a circle and take out their nest
Into the fire, we all been mislead

Battle is raging prepare to attack
Made out of fire they clobber my back
The living and dead in a final ballet

Let's summon the dead, we all stand together
But we thought the spirits would rest on this day
How could we be so blind? Stop the dance start the slay

All of the damned - dia de los muertos
All of the damned - los angelitos, los innocentes

So listen, beware,
Remember what they said
That life is best
Enjoyed after death

[Solo: Oscar / Both]

"I Refuse"

My guard is down, accept my invitation
But don't waste my time, with your slandering lies

Cuz my dream is my dream
All based on my revelations
Extreme, but not mean
And I'll stand the test of time

You say you like me, your my friend, but I got stabbed in the back
Remove that smile and wash the blood off your hands

I Refuse, I Refuse

You call my name, but you don't know me
Say I'm insane, but who's to blame

Cuz I'll scream and I'll scream
And I'm building up a reputation
I esteem by all means
Cuz I swim against the stream

You turn the page and write the story of a life you don't know
My sword is sharp and mighter than your pen

I Refuse, I Refuse

I Refuse, I Refuse
Refuse to be something that I'm not

[Solo: Pontus]

I Refuse, I Refuse
I Refuse, I Refuse

I Refuse, I Refuse
Refuse to be something that I'm not

"666 - The Enemy Within"

As I wake up from my slumber
From a deep, enchanted sleep
There’s a pain, there’s a mark, there’s a wound
The trail of blood is running deep

There’s an echo in the mirror,
Of a man I don’t know
Starring back at the scar on my neck
And the numbers are Screaming...

Six, six, six, grab the holy crucifix
Skies turn red high above the river Styx

Kneeling down in desperation
As I start to speak in tongues
When I praise the old man down below
I recite the mantra

Six, six, six, twist the holy crucifix
Grab the oars scull across the river Styx

It’s the evil in me
The enemy within my soul the subjugator

[Solo: Oscar]

Six, six, six
get the holy crucifix
Throw it in
into Acheron on Styx

[Solo: Pontus]

Six, six, six
sinking like a tons of bricks
One way pass
over Acheron and Styx

It’s the evil in me
The enemy within my soul the subjugator

"Immortalized"

Heed the war cry for glory
Hear them calling your name
Hold your ground, show no mercy
For freedom in anger, now maim

Another angel is dying - Falling
His entry to heaven denied - Falling from the skies
Predestined to walk and fend in the darkness - Fortune
Reveal the gates of hell - Hex, Immortalized

The fallen, they walk all among us - Angels
Their broken wings will not bear - Angels in disguise
Etrnal dawn, in torment and anguish - Dawning
Bound to stagger this land - Hex, Immortal

[Solo: Oscar / Pontus]

We walk the line, we stand alone eternally
We're cursed to live, we cannot die, Immortalized

[Solo: Oscar]

Time goes by, now the angels feed the eternal flame
Stand your ground, cursed immortal
The Hex is now stuck to your name

"Let's Get It On"

Standing alone, it's the ultimate proving ground
As real as it gets, we are soldiers of one-man armies

Burning inside, hear the audience scream
We've got a yearning inside to fulfill our destiny

The lights go down, no more fears
The crowd goes wild, music to our ears

Get it on
Let's Get it On - It on
Come on, get it on - It on
Let's Get it On - It on
Come on, get it on

[Solo: Oscar]

Nowhere to run, like an animal caged and cornered
Standing so proud, it's the life we have chosen

(We do what) We were bred to do, were trained to do
We live to do
what we were born to do

Get it on
Let's Get it On - It on
Come on, get it on - It on
Let's Get it On - It on
Come on, get it on

[Solo: Pontus]

Pulled from the ashes and forged from tradition
The essence of power, behold demolition

Are you ready?
Are you ready? - Get!
Are you ready? - It!
Are you ready? - On!

Come on, get it on

Let's get it on
Come on, get it on

Get it on
Let's Get it On - It on
Come on, get it on - It on
Let's Get it On - It on
Come on, get it on
Let's get it on
Come on, get it on

"Redemption"

I gave up my life
To follow another destiny
To find the hidden sun
The source of the spark and the flame

Now the universe is closed
Let the blackening, dissolution start
The aether shining, impurified
Let's burnout the vile from the dark

I kneel down and pray
The elements gather around me
Envision my destined path
I can no longer avoid
I see the...

Black sun rising
Fall, material god
Opus Magnum
Seize Redemption

My uprising
Find the sun and the moon
Absolution
Seize Redemption

Unification, the spiritualized will unlock the gate be unlimited
Unification of man and his god will limit your life lock the gate

[Solo: Oscar / Pontus]

Now the elements are at peace
Come the reddening, gaze upon the sky
Seven planets, silver and gold
The seven metals aligned
And now the...

Black sun rising
Fall, material god
Opus Magnum
Seize Redemption

My uprising
Find the sun and the moon
Absolution
Seize Redemption
