"Any Means Necessary"

I won't pull the trigger

Just to see you die
No remedy to make me come alive

I'm ticking like a timebomb,

(Need) no fuse, just guts and gore
(To) initiate the burning of the core

I count down to zero, pull the trigger, no parole
No mercy, have mercy, no mercy on your soul

Kill by any means necessary
Win by any means necessary
Live by any means necessary
Die by any means necessary

I am not judgemental
A sinner nor a saint
Cause either you're my best friend or you ain't

Come gather here around me
feel my breath under your skin
I'm deadly, only when I'm getting caught

Counting down to zero, I'm a soldier without soul
No mercy, have mercy, no mercy on your soul

Kill by any means necessary
Win by any means necessary
Live by any means necessary
Die by any means necessary

I am born to kill - Judge and condemn
I am born to win - Slay and maim 'em
I am born to live - Fight for glory
I am born to die

Kill - Win - Live - Die

[Solo: Oscar, Pontus, Oscar]

Kill by any means necessary
Win by any means necessary
Live by any means necessary
Die by any means necessary

I am born to kill - Judge and condemn
I am born to win - Slay and maim 'em
I am born to live - Fight for glory
I am born to die - Memento mori

I am born to kill - Judge and condemn
I am born to win - Slay and maim 'em
I am born to live - Fight for glory
I am born to die - Memento mori...

"Life Is Now"

6 am, we still rush along
The open road and we're feeling strong
Another town - HEY! - just lay it down, down to the ground
Only our way, or the highway straight to hell

Never give up, never give in
Always ride out the storms, so fight
Never give up, never give in
It's your life make it right

Our life is not a fashion - Life is Now
Pedal to the metal - Life is Now
Our life is based on passion
And we live our lives the way we want

Hit the lights, time to bring it on
Ten thousand fists, they can not be wrong
We've come to slam - HEY! - the hammer down, never lose the game
Please come inside, do not be afraid, ain't no requiem

Never give up, never give in
Only one way to shout and scream
Never give up, never give in
Please take hold of your dream

Our life is not a fashion - Life is Now
Pedal to the metal - Life is Now
Our life is based on passion - Life is Now
And we live our lives the way we want

[Solo: Pontus]

Our life is not a fashion
Pedal to the metal
Our life is based on passion
And we live our lives the way we want

Our life is not a fashion
Pedal to the metal
Our life is based on passion
And we live our lives the way we want

Our life is not a fashion - Life is Now
Pedal to the metal - Life is Now
Our life is based on passion - Life is Now
And we live our lives the way we want - Life is Now

Our life is not a fashion - Life is Now
Pedal to the metal - Life is Now
Our life is based on passion - Life is Now
And we live our lives the way we want

Never give up, oh, never give in
This is your life, a thing you can't set aside

"Punish And Enslave"

It's midnight, the clock strikes twelve
When the beasts come out and play
The headlines made it clear
Judgement day is near

They're crawling down the street
Sinking their razor teeth
They're knocking on every door
Now the steel begins to glow

They're vaporizing the earth, no mercy
Into the battle they thrust
With power and lust

Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave
Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave

There's something, a single spark
Out there in the dark
The metal is shining bright
Brings back hope and light

Bumber-to-bumber he reigns the wasteland
Turning their steel into dust, he will never rust

Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave
Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave

[Solo: Pontus]

All hail the chosen one - Fight proud, don't touch the sun
Come join our steel parade - Together in the last crusade
All drop the hammers down - Burn out, reclaim the crown
Speed demons never turn - at speed of light we ride, running flat-out let's crash and burn

They're vaporizing the earth, no mercy
Into the battle they thrust
Bumber-to-bumber he reigns the wasteland
Turning their steel into dust, he will never rust

Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave
Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave

Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave
Oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh...
Punish and Enslave

"Legion"

The war still remains
No Kingdom on earth
There's only pure evil, indifference to birth

In the tombs of the dead
One man breeds alone
The unearthly warfare shadows the throne

Three temptations written down
The Lust of flesh, lust of the eyes
Finally the pride of life

The Demon Twelve, the hell hounds
My name is Legion, for we are many spirits inside of one
To build a land of chaos, brought forth from the Abyss
My name is Legion, and we bring destruction and death

Possessing his soul
The curse of the damned
A tormented victim, to the bottom he's slammed

One man stands alone
Tripped, under a spell
Encounter your demons, send them to Hell

No temptations left to fend
Sanctified, Anti Christ
Casting shadows towards the cross

The Demon Twelve, the hell hounds
My name is Legion, for we are many spirits inside of one
To build a land of chaos, brought forth from the Abyss
My name is Legion, and we bring destruction and death

[Solo: Pontus, Oscar, Pontus, Oscar, Pontus, Oscar, Pontus, Oscar, Pontus, Oscar]

The Demon Twelve, the hell hounds
My name is Legion, for we are many spirits inside of one
To build a land of chaos, brought forth from the Abyss
My name is Legion, and we bring destruction and death

"Between Two Worlds"

In the distant maze, I see two doors
One leads to change, one leads to where I've been before
I am an angel, on broken wings
I am the beast, the devil and all in between
Nothing at all

It's never dark here, it's never light
Feeling like I'm caught between two worlds
Between two worlds

When the night comes down, the blade comes out
I wish, I wish, I wish I felt something at all
Nothing's wrong or right, nor black or white
Behind the hurt I see the lust come shining through
What do I do

Just like the rainbow, between mist and sun
Feeling like I'm trapped between two worlds
Between two worlds

[Solo: Oscar]

Never laugh or smile, I never cry
My mind is numb, and I can't take it anymore
Screaming in frustration, no sound is heard
Am I asleep, or am I starring in a dream
Please wake me up

Sometimes the hunter, sometimes the prey
Feeling like I'm trapped, lost and never found
Feeling like I'm caught between two worlds
Without a home

"Hallowed Be My Name"

I cover the trail behind me, stay out of the light
There's something alive in the darkness
I can feel the power and it's might

For years I have walked in the shadows
banned for my believes
Cause around me the walls are falling
Bridges burn, in flames without a spark

Cause I'm searching high and low
Through dark places I must go
I am the one you should not blame
Hallowed be my Name - My Name

There's no place for me in heaven, nor a place in hell
Sentenced to walk here forever
This will be my final place to dwell

I walk alone, no legions will follow my path
A stranger to my own shadow
But something's wrong I can feel it to the bone

When I stand on sea and shore
Storms will rage and oceans roar
I raise my hammer, take my aim
Hallowed be my Name - My Name

[Solo: Oscar, Pontus]

Vultures fly, the ravens cry
No stars are shining on the darkened sky
One allegiance, sun and moon
My eyes are red my soul is turning into black

When I stand on sea and shore
Storms will rage and oceans roar
I raise my hammer, take my aim
Cause Hallowed be my Name

You can lie and crush my heart
Steal my soul, tear me apart
Still it's something you can not claim
Hallowed be my Name - My Name

"No Sacrifice, No Victory"

Sacrifice - Victory
No Sacrifice - No Victory

Once there was gold at the end of the rainbow
Honored by blood we kept searching for more
Light turned to dark as we lost what we fought for
Now we have come to settle the score

Sacrifice - Victory
No Sacrifice - No Victory

Light, brings us light on the pale darkened heavens
Lead us towards our vast victory
Fighting for all that we brothers believe in
Together, united we're standing all for one

On our pathway to glory, we stand together honored by blood
Sacrifice our resplendence, we fight for freedom, hold our grounds forever
By the code we are living, we are breathing, and then we die
Sacrifice our own lives, but we'll never stand to lose our pride and glory

[Solo: Pontus]

In the end only truth will survive, no matter what you sacrifice
So you can't harvest your glory all based on deceit, cause no one will swallow your lies

On our pathway to glory, we stand together honored by blood
Sacrifice our resplendence, we fight for freedom, hold our grounds forever
By the code we are living, we are breathing, and then we die
Sacrifice our own lives, but we'll never stand to lose our pride and glory

Sacrifice - Victory
Sacrifice - Victory
Victory

"Bring The Hammer Down"

There was a time when we were noble soldiers
Fearless and wild, a fight just to survive
Reformed our troops, one flag one worlds united
Under the sun the powers came alive

The sound of our cause, the meaning of life
Beyond stars and skies
Now raise your hands and let it all come out

Bring the Hammer Down
Slam it down to the ground
One flag, one world united

Templars, fight or fall
Raise your fists, heed the call
Bring the Hammer Down, behold the light

The future holds nothing but pain and sorrow
No painted skies, we dwell in black and white
Just live your life, like there is no tomorrow
Present today, forgotten before dawn

Still counting the stars, in search for a way
The meaning of life
Now raise your hands before your time runs out

Bring the Hammer Down
Slam it down to the ground
One flag, one world united

Templars, fight or fall
Raise your fists, heed the call
Bring the Hammer Down, behold the light

[Solo: Pontus, Stefan, both]

Bring the Hammer Down
Slam it down to the ground
One flag, one world united

Templars, fight or fall
Raise your fists, heed the call
Bring the Hammer Down, behold the light

"One Of A Kind"

Rising forces, thunder in the east
No fearless warrior could subdue the beast
No gallant man around could stand and hold his ground

Days passed by and weeks turned into years
Every drip of hope became a sea of fears
Somewhere in the dark, a light or just a spark

Brothers in arms fighting one for all
Fearless and wild we stand tall, one of a kind
No turning back, brothers fight or fall
Standing together, we fight, one of a kind

Years of darkness all torn by fate's hand
A nation cursed, once glorious and grand
From the ashes we will rise, like a Phoenix to the skies

Brothers in arms fighting one for all
Fearless and wild we stand tall, one of a kind
No turning back, brothers fight or fall
Standing together, we fight, one of a kind

[Solo: Oscar]

Come take my hand, don't leave me here all alone
Come make a stand, don't let us all fade away, fade away

[Solo: Pontus]

1666 - We stood in the valley of death
Steel in our hands, the final command
To cure and to heal our nation

Mighty warriors - mount up don't stare at the ground
Hold your heads high, resist and defy
Fighting, defending, we're screaming, avenging you all
We're standing all for one for all
One voice we're one of a kind, we are
Never look back, never surrender

We're fighting all for one for all
One heart, we're one of a kind, we are
Cause we are here and we are fighting

Brothers in arms fighting one for all
Fearless and wild we stand tall, one of a kind
No turning back, brothers fight or fall
Standing together, we fight, one of a kind

Fighting, defending, we're screaming, avenging you all

One of a kind
